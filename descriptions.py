isb_sizes_description = '''Description: A dictionary controlling the size of the inter-stage buffers of the pipeline. The variable isb_s0s1 controls the size of the isb between stage0 and stage1. Similarly isb_s1s2 dictates the size of the isb between stage1 and stage2 and so on. By increasing isb_s0s1 and isb_s1s2 one can shadow the stalls or latencies in the backend stages of the pipeline by fetching more instructions into the front-end stages of the pipeline.
There is a restriction however that isb_s2s3 should always be 1. This is because the outputs of register file accessed in stage2 are not buffered and niether is the bypass scheme implemented to handle this scenario.
One can however increase the number of in-flight instructions by increasing the sizes of isb_s3s4 and isb_s4s5 (increasing isb_s3s4 has a larger impact).
Also note that if write-after-write stalls are disabled , the size of the wawid is defined by the sum of isb_s3s4 and isb_s4s5. Therefore, increasing in-flight instructions caused a logarithmic increase in the wawid used for maintaining bypass of operands.'''
